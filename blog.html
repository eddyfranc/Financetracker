        <h2>What is Instant Withdrawal?</h2>
        <p>Instant Withdrawal is a feature offered by **HarakaPay Freelance** that allows freelancers to withdraw their earnings immediately to their bank account or mobile wallet (like M-Pesa).

        <h2>Why Freelancers Need Instant Withdrawals</h2>

The platform ensures the transaction is completed within minutes, allowing you to access your funds immediately.</p>
